This is the source code of a casual project about a Wi-Fi clock based on one single nixie tube and a serial-to-parallel shift register circuit.

This commit has implemented functions include:
- Basic time display.
- RTC time save and read.
- Wi-Fi connection thru SmartConfig, along with Wi-Fi configuration saved in non-volatile storage.
- IP address display.
- Time synchronization thru NTP server.
- Access to MQTT server, publish and subscribe topics.  

And more to come.
